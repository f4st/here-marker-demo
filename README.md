# here-marker-demo

- User sample (https://github.com/illabo/here-marker-demo) with additional code for UIImage runtime adjustment.

NOTE: The adjustment is made for demo purposes and is not recommended to use as is due to performance effect. 
To achieve max performance the image for marker should be already optimized before runtime: 
 - resized
 - have RGB color space.
